\begin{abstract}
The Story Cloze Test (Mostafazadeh et al. \cite{cloze}) is a framework that was developed for evaluating story understanding and script learning. In this task, given the first 4 sentences of a story, we are tasked to choose the 5th ending sentence between two possible endings to the story.
We describe in this paper different Neural Models that we used to solve this task: a BERT Model, a Hidden Coherence Model and a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) Model. Our best performing model was the BERT model with an accuracy of 85.73\% on the test set

\section{Introduction}

You can keep this short. Ideally you introduce the task already in a way that highlights the difficulties  your method will tackle.
\section{Methodology}
Your idea. You can rename this section if you like. Early on in this section -- but not necessarily first -- make clear what category your method falls into: Is it generative? Discriminative? Is there a particular additional data source you want to use?
\section{Model}
The math/architecture of your model. This should formally describe your idea from above. If you really want to, you can merge the two sections.
\section{Training}
What is your objective? How do you optimize it?

\section{Experiments}
This {\bf must} at least include the accuracy of your method on the validation set.
\section{Conclusion}
You can keep this short, too.
